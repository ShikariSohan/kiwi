## System Design
This microservices-based project comprises four core services: UserService, PdfService, WritingService, and BotService, each hosted on separate servers to ensure scalability and optimal performance. Additionally, two essential modules, the Gateway and Discovery Server, are employed for inter-service communication and load balancing.
### Service Responsibilities:
**UserService:** This service handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management.  

**BotService:** Equipped with AI capabilities, BotService interprets and responds to user commands intelligently.  

**PdfService:** PdfService leverages AI for image generation and manages storybook PDFs.

**WritingService:** This service integrates OCR functionality, accepting images and returning extracted text.  

The project relies on two databases, User and Pdf, closely linked with User and Pdf services. Firebase Cloud Service is also utilized for enhanced functionality.  

The following diagram visually represents the end-to-end flow of the project, illustrating the interactions between services, databases, and external resources.
